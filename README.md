🧬 My research focuses on plant **genomics**, specifically unraveling the **multi-omic** features underlying meiotic **recombination** in *Brassica napus*. I employ computational biology and **machine learning**. A key aspect of my work involves managing large genomic and multi-omic datasets, writing code to detect crossovers in population genomic data, and developing predictive models to predict the main features associated with recombination.

💻 I am passionate about **bioinformatics** and always eager to learn new methods to optimize my work. I have extensive experience with [**R**](https://github.com/GoliczGenomeLab/haploMAGIC) and Markdown, love to script in Shell and [Quarto/RMarkdown](https://jamonterotena.github.io/bnapus.reco.ml/gw_workflow.html), show graphs interactively using [Shiny apps](https://jamonterotena.github.io/The-Impact-of-Oil-Crops/), and I can also code in Python and SQL.

🛤️ I enjoy sharing projects related to my research to support the scientific community, as well as sharing code and tips that have been helpful on my self-learning journey.

[🗺️](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=12CGiKDJXOIl6qPWeO5j033FQyP9AkqU&usp=sharing) Originally from Spain, I have worked as a Science teacher at a senior school in England driven by my passion for education and I am currently completing my PhD in Germany. I speak Spanish, English and German fluently.
