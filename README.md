🧬 My research focuses on plant **genomics**, specifically unraveling the **multi-omic** features underlying meiotic **recombination** in *Brassica napus*. I employ computational biology and **machine learning**. A key aspect of my work involves managing large genomic and multi-omic datasets, writing code to detect crossovers in population genomic data, and developing predictive models to predict the main features associated with recombination.

💻 I am passionate about **bioinformatics** and always eager to learn new methods to optimize my work. I have extensive experience with **R** and RMarkdown, I regularly write scripts in Shell and Quarto, and I can also code in Python and SQL.

🛤️ I enjoy sharing projects related to my research to support the scientific community, as well as sharing code and tips that have been helpful on my self-learning journey.
