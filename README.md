🛤️ Welcome to my GitHub profile, where I share my research to support the scientific community, along with code or tips that have been useful in my self-learning journey.

## About my work

🧬 My research centers on plant **genomics**, specifically analzying lage **multiomic** data sets to unravel the determinants of meiotic **recombination** in *Brassica napus*, a line of work that contributes to the broader goal of enhancing the crop’s genetic diversity.

🌱 This interactive Shiny visualization illustrates [*the impact of rapeseed compared with other oil crops*—across country, region, and globally](https://jamonterotena.github.io/The-Impact-of-Oil-Crops/).

## 💻 My skills

Thanks to my extensive experience with **R**, I developed a tool for [phasing and detected recombination crossovers in multiparental populations with high accuracy despite of genotyping errors](https://github.com/GoliczGenomeLab/haploMAGIC), that was proved to [outperform related software in benchmarking](https://academic.oup.com/g3journal/article/14/8/jkae109/7684607).

I prepare well-structured Quarto/RMarkdown notebooks to document the outcome and code of my pipelines—for example, [this workflow for analyzing recombination data with machine learning](https://jamonterotena.github.io/bnapus.reco.ml/gw_workflow.html)—and share them with colleagues to support decision-making.

I’m hard-working, curious, and always eager to build new skills to optimize my work and to help my team.

I regularly use Bash scripting coding to operate Linux terminals, and I am also proficient in Python and SQL.

## My background

[🗺️](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=12CGiKDJXOIl6qPWeO5j033FQyP9AkqU&usp=sharing) Originally from Spain, I have worked as a Science teacher at a senior school in England, driven by my passion for education, and I am currently completing my PhD in Germany. I speak Spanish, English and German fluently.
