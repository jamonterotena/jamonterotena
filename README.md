🧬 My research focuses on plant genomics, specifically unraveling the genetic, genomic, or epigenomic features underlying recombination in Brassica napus. I employ advanced bioinformatics and computational biology techniques. A key aspect of my work involves managing large genomic datasets, writing code to detect crossovers in population genomic data, and developing machine learning models to predict the main features associated with recombination.

💻 I am passionate about bioinformatics and always eager to learn new methods to optimize my work. I have extensive experience with R and RMarkdown, and I regularly write scripts in Bash and Quarto.

🛤️ I enjoy sharing projects related to my research to support the scientific community, as well as sharing code and tips that have been helpful on my self-learning journey.
