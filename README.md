🧬 My research focuses on plant **genomics**, specifically unraveling the genetic, genomic, or epigenomic features underlying **recombination** in *Brassica napus*. I employ advanced bioinformatics and computational biology techniques. A key aspect of my work involves managing large genomic datasets, writing code to detect crossovers in population genomic data, and developing **machine learning** models to predict the main features associated with recombination.

💻 I am passionate about **bioinformatics** and always eager to learn new methods to optimize my work. I have extensive experience with **R** and RMarkdown, and I regularly write scripts in Shell and Quarto.

🛤️ I enjoy sharing projects related to my research to support the scientific community, as well as sharing code and tips that have been helpful on my self-learning journey.

🗺️ Originally from Spain, I have worked as a Science teacher in England driven by my passion for education and I am currently completing my PhD in Germany. I speak Spanish, English and German fluently.
